<p><h5>Thought I'd share a time-lapse of my fursona (Kane) being made ^^</h5></p>

<p><h5>This ref sheet was made by pent_alah (or dreaming_alecs) over on instagram! (links below ^^)</h5></p>

<p><h5>I seriously adore this art piece and I'm so so grateful for this commission!!</h5></p>

<p><h5>They are great to work with as they're patient and are understanding with people who may be indecisive or have difficulties speaking to other people, (totally not me or anything *sweats)</h5></p>

<p><h5>They are really trustworthy as I've commissioned them for over 2 years and have handled the whole process very professionally!</h5></p>

<p><h5>Keep in mind that whenever you commission someone, always be mindful that the person you are speaking to is a real person. No matter the artist, they cannot produce everything to 100% match your specs or finish a commission within a day. Always respect the artist and you shall get respect back.</h5></p>

<p><h5>I was going to upload this months ago when I got the commission done but I forgot due to pressure I was facing on the last few weeks of my course, which kinda sent me crazy (sorry :/)</h5></p>

<p><h5>Anyways I highly recommend checking out their commission's as I value their art a whole lot :)</h5></p>

<p><h5>-</h5></p>

<p><h5>edit: the tail is now a blue colour like the body since I think it looks better :3</h5></p>

<p><h5>edit 2: I'm also working on a website in my free time which I'll use to show off my fursona as I thought it'd be neat to do. however don't expect it to be done anytime soon as it's just something I do in my free time.</h5></p>

<p><h5>Anyways if you've read this far, have a great day/night :)</h5></p>
